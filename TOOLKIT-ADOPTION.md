# Toolkit standards adoption

Which entries of the wheel toolkit's standards ledger
(`E:\Source\toolkits\dbce-wheel-mod-toolkit\STANDARDS.md`) this mod has brought in.
Update a row in the same commit that adopts it. Statuses: `adopted`, `partial`,
`pending`, `n/a` (say why), `unchecked` (nobody has looked yet).
Seeded 2026-10-04 from what was verified that day; `unchecked` rows need a look.

| Standard | Title | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| STD-001 | One mod per game | unchecked |  |
| STD-002 | Recording and playback from launch | n/a | Superseded by STD-012; input determinism is not established. |
| STD-003 | Normalized FFB strength | unchecked |  |
| STD-004 | Consistent settings UX | unchecked |  |
| STD-005 | Camera numpad layout 8/2 9/3 4/6 7/1 +/- 5 | unchecked |  |
| STD-006 | Camera step sizes are settings | unchecked |  |

| STD-008 | Display changes: game applies once | unchecked |  |
| STD-009 | Dashboard telemetry matches the HUD | unchecked |  |
| STD-010 | Install the latest build for testing | unchecked |  |
| STD-011 | Work lands on main | adopted | This scoped playback intake was merged/pushed to master; accepted runtime remains independently identified. |
| STD-012 | Reproduce the route and preserve original signals | pending | Native hook/output/startup boundaries inspected; existing 128-frame force-calculation recorder passes offline tests but lacks external runtime capture and gameplay replay. See docs/STAGE-PLAYBACK.md. |
